		<p class="justify">It's like having Santa's little helper as your personal assistant. For just $15, you'll get $180 in store credits from 12 online businesses that align with your simple, natural lifestyle.</p>
		<p class="justify">It means glad tidings for your bank account and frees up your December evenings while you buy unique gifts for all the good girls and boys on your list. Now you can have your fruitcake and eat it, too.</p>
